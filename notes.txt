   SELECT c.category_name,
          COUNT(p.post_id) AS num_posts
     FROM CATEGORY c
LEFT JOIN POSTS p ON p.category_id = c.category_id
You can create a view to house the query mentioned above, so you can query the view just like you would a table...

But if you're set on storing the number, use:

UPDATE CATEGORY
   SET count = count + 1
 WHERE category_id = ?
