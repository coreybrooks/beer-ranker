# Beer-Battles

### Overview
Beer Battles is an interactive web application created by Corey Brooks, Jeff Mensing, Toby Boyd and Karl Girling.  This app is designed to allow users to vote on their favorite beer in a battle to find the best (or most popular).

This project was built using an MVC structure.  The backend of this full-stack application incorporates Node.js and Express to route get and post request.  The beers up for battle and the user choice history are both stored in MySQL using a Sequelize ORM.
